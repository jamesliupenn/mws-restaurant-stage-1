# Udacity Grow with Google Scholarship Mobile Web Specialist Project

This is the capstone project for Udacity's Grow with Google Scholarship program in Mobile Web Specialist. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

### Installing

Git clone the repository (or download the zipped files):

```
git clone https://github.com/jamesliupenn/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git
```

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<map_token>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

1. Under the root directory, serve up a simple HTTP server from the command line by replacing `<PORT>` with any available port:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer <PORT>
```

If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With the server running, open up your browser and visit the site: `http://localhost:<PORT>`.
